# Imperivm : Great Battles of Rome Translation Mod

A mod I made back in 2009 that translates the game [Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome](https://haemimontfans.wordpress.com/imperivm-iii-the-great-battles-of-rome/) from Spanish to English.
Most assets (e.g. voices, translation text) are ripped from its prequel Nemesis of the Roman Empire.

## Instructions 
Copy and paste Settings.ini and CURRENTLANG folder into the folder "Imperivm - Las Grandes Batallas de Roma"
