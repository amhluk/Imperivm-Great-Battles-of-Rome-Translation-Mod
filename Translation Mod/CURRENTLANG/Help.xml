      <entry>
During the game some parts of the map are covered with dark mist and some are pure black. This effect is called fog of war. It can be turned off from the game settings in a strategic game.

The black areas are not explored yet and you have no information what terrain they cover or if there are enemies there. Units passing close to such black areas explore them and the black disappears never to appear again.

The darker areas are covered with fog, which means that you will not see the enemy units there.

There is a bright area around your units and structures where you see every unit, be it friend or foe.

The map of the Imperivm III - the Great Battles of Rome is extremely detailed and represents a snapshot of the area taken from above. On it all structures and units of the explored area could be seen, each with the color of its player. 
During the course of the game additional icons would also appear on the map indicating note locations, starving units, ongoing battles or sieges, as well as recently completed productions.

The map could be viewed and removed with the spacebar or the map button.

There are two types of resources - food and gold. 
			</entry>
      <entry image="UI/help/food ico.bmp">Food is produced in villages. It is essential to maintain the health of  all units and is used for population increase as well as army support (except for Carthage) and to equip units for Germania. </entry>
      <entry image="UI/help/gold ico.bmp">
Gold is produced in strongholds. It is a source of richness and power and is used to upgrade structures, equip units, hire heroes, etc.
			</entry>
      <entry>The quantities produced depend on the population of the village or stronghold - the greater the number of inhabitants the greater the production.
			</entry>
      <entry>
Both are stored in strongholds, villages and outposts and could only be used or spent in their current location. If you want to use some gold or food in elsewhere you first have to transport it to the desired destination (be it village, outpost or stronghold) by using mules. Should the mule be killed in the process the resources are lost.

    <topic id="capturing">

      <entry image="UI/help/commands/capture.bmp">
Structures in Imperivm III cannot be built. However, they could be won and lost, destroyed and repaired numerous times during the course of the game.
Every structure has a level of loyalty and cannot be taken before that level becomes 0. To become the owner of a structure you must use the capture command of your army.
Should the capturing cease before the structure is yours, or defenders are nearby, its loyalty will slowly start growing again.
In addition the capture command could be used to capture food or gold mules.
			</entry>
      <entry />
      <entry>
In multiplayer mode there are a vast number of villages, and outposts, which are neutral. Such structures are captured instantly by the first player to reach them.

Every unit requires to be fed and carries a small supply of food. The carried amount could be seen next to the food icon at the top of the screen (when the unit is selected).
			</entry>
      <entry />
      <entry>
When a unit runs out of food it begins to starve, at which point its health begins to decrease. You could tell that a unit is starving by the empty dish icon, which becomes visible on the map.

      <entry />
      <entry>
A unit could eat from a caravan or a settlement (outpost, village or stronghold). When eating the unit's health increases - slowly if it's in the open, and faster if in a structure.

      <entry>
Unlike normal military units heroes should not be considered fighters per se. Their main strength lies in the ability to attach a group of up to 50 units, which from then on would follow their commands.
			</entry>
      <entry />
      <entry>
When attached, the units receive part of the hero's experience as a bonus to their own. In addition heroes arrange armies in specific formations that provide their units with an additional bonus when executing the stand ground command.

      <entry>
There are four types of formations that heroes could position their troops:

      <entry>Unlike units each hero has five skills that are unique to them and their civilization. These improve not only their individual combat abilities but also that of their army.  Some of them are beneficial to the hero and the units attached to the hero.  Other skills are beneficial to the units or help you during your battles.Each time that your hero reaches a  new level, a "+" sign appears on its icon.  This indicates that you can reinforce one of its special characteristics by assigning him additional experience points (to a maximum of 10).  </entry>

The health of a unit represents its general condition. When it reaches zero health the unit dies.

When a unit is selected, a health bar appears under its icon. The green part of the bar represents the unit's current health. Numeric values are also present, right under the health bar itself.

When several units are selected the bar shows the average health of the entire group.

If a hero with attached army is selected the upper health bar shows his health, and the lower - that of the units attached to him.
The health of a unit represents its general condition. When it reaches zero health the unit dies.
				
If you press Ctrl - reverse quote (`) on your keyboard, a health bar and stamina bar will appear on each unit.  The green bar shows the unit's health and the blue bar shows the unit's stamina.</entry>

A certian amount of stamina is used for each special ability. When the units use up all their stamina, they must wait for it to regenerate

Every unit has a certain amount of experience that determines its level. As the level increases more experience is required to reach the next level. With each level the units gain 5 points bonus to their maximum health (20 for hero units). Higher level means that the unit will do more damage to less experienced units while receiving less.

The unit's experience increases with each kill depending on the experience of the enemy unit. The same effect could be achieved through training with an allied military unit.

The level of the selected unit is shown next to its name preceded by an icon with the letter L.

        <entry>The value of damage represents the amount of damage a unit can inflict on an enemy of equal level.  The amount of damage inflicted when the unit attacks an enemy depends on the unit's level, the level of the enemy, the armor of the enemy, and the special ability and stamina of both units during the battle.  

For example, if a Tribune with 40 damage is facing a gladiator with 10 armor, 30 damage with be inflicted on the gladiator.  When the Armor is equal or greater than the Damage of the enemy, the damage inflicted is reduced by 20%.</entry>

For example, if a gladiator with 10 Armor is attacked by a Tribune with 40 Damage, the gladiator will receive 30 damage.

The notes can be viewed in the notes window. To popup the notes window deselect all units and press the “Notes” button on the menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. In addition to its title each note has a description and sometimes a location that is associated with the note. The notes that have locations associated with them can be seen on the map as well.

During the adventure game you will be given series of objectives. While some of them will be essential for the advancement of the adventure story, others only serve as bonus tasks for the player to complete if he chooses, and will provide some kind of reward - an increase of level, an item, additional troops, etc.

When a new objective is given a note appears in the notes window. Consequentially when an objective is completed the note vanishes.

The shipyard uses boats when instructed to tribute resources to another shipyard.
Caravans are used to supply resources to an outpost, village or stronghold.

The Teuton tent is an isolated settlement of a small Teuton tribe. When independent the tent supports up to 50 Teuton Riders and Archers. After a player conquers the tent he can order the garrison that is reduced to maximum of 20 warriors.
The tent garrison increases with 2 warriors every 32 seconds up to the current maximum.

Ancient and mysterious it is said that the arcane structure or stonehenge holds many secrets. Believed to be built by the druids a stonehenge represents one of the greatest sacred places where druids perform their rituals. Lately roman priests too have acquired the knowledge to use its powers for their own needs.
A few druids, priests, shamans or enchantresses gathered at the stonehenge can perform arcane rituals that influence the whole world by charging it.

Remains of past times, ruins often hold treasures. However, it is rumored that they are full of dangers as well. That is the reason why only heroes of a certain level dare enter and come back with a valuable item. 
The current required level and the item present are visible in the Ruins'﻿ interface.

      <entry>Each unit (excluding battleships, boats, caravans, and wildlife) can carry a maximum of 4 items. Some items can increase the stats of a unit, other items can attack or heal units.  Some items can do both.  You can use an item by double-clicking on it.  When a unit dies, it drops a leather bag which contains the items it was carrying.</entry>
